Just some Notes and stuff you might find handy.




1. Navbars are set up right, just have to remove the dev bar
2. key word is 'michaelwashere'
3. Dont forget to change the login/logout swapping in the navbar
4. teacher profile page is accessable to students while teacher
	is logged in(cant change password without knowing old one,
	but can change login email. might have to make a new page
	to address this?
5. I changed up teacher_session a little, made it nicer.
6. All unused footers should be removed before release.
7. We need to discuss a way to create default passwords,
	the way I have it set now the admin or tech makes the
	password for the user when profile is created.
8. I did not make any permanent changes to the css files, but I
	did find a way to change the panel color, by changing the
	main bootstrap.css.
